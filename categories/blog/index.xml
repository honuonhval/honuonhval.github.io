      <description>Taking couple days off on a weekend getaway I saw a Twitter post about a CTF hosted by cr0wn. I&amp;rsquo;ve played couple CTFs and enjoyed working through the problems so I decided I&amp;rsquo;ll spend some time on it. Thankfully the problem I chose was really enjoyable and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned some new things going through it. More importantly, there is a subject that I am inspired to dig into as well.</description>

      <description>Cannot find socat on this thing Socat is so cool. It is a tool comparable to netcat but has some extra features that make it worth it to learn how to use. It is installed in Kali Linux by default. It is also only a pacman -S socat away in Arch Linux, but not readily available in Windows.
Actually, with quick search, I did find several binaries to download but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel right downloading random .</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time I give back. There are so many great resources around the web that I&amp;rsquo;ve benefited from which would not have been available had someone did not choose to share. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for those that shared before me.
Thank you.
My turn.</description>
